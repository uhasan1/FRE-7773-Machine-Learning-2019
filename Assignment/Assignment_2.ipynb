    "# Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "## General\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the same train and test datasets as was used in the lecture.  Instructions below for where to find them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As usual: your grade depends on **both** the correct answer and properly presenting your process (as in the \"Recipe\" taught in class, and the Geron book Appendix B)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You will classify whether a passenger Survives or not using Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You may use the code presented in class to **start** your assignment but I expect you to significantly enhance it.  For example: you may use my code to get you started with plotting but it is up to you to decide whether this alone suffices.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use 5-fold cross validation for all models.  Report the average as your result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific goals to address\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a baseline model against which you will compare your models.\n",
    "    - Discuss your choice.  Is this the best baseline model to use ?\n",
    "    - Create a variable SCORE_BASELINE that contains a Python scalar value: the accuracy for your baseline model.\n",
    "2. You will conduct several experiments \n",
    "    - present a Confusion Matrix for each experiment and discuss\n",
    "    - you will create several variables per experiment that will be used for grading.\n",
    "        - The variables for experiment 1 will have suffix \"_1\". For experiment 2, they will have suffix \"_2\", etc.\n",
    "3. Experiment 1\n",
    "    - You will *extend* the results presented in the lecture\n",
    "        - use the same features\n",
    "        - use the same way of dealing with missing features\n",
    "        - be sure to treat categorical features correctly\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - Create a variable SCORE_1 that contains a Python scalar value: the accuracy for your experiment.\n",
    "    - Create a variable MISCLASSIFIED_SURVIVE_1 that contains a Python list of *at least 10* passengers\n",
    "        - the list should contain the identity of passengers that were mis-classified as Surviving.\n",
    "        - the \"identity\" of a passenger should be given as the  *row number* within the test data set,\n",
    "        - The first row is considered row 0\n",
    "    - Create a variable MISCLASSIFIED_NOT_SURVIVE_1 that contains a Python list of *at least 10* passengers\n",
    "        - the list should contain the \"identity\" of passengers that were mis-classified as Not Surviving.\n",
    "        - The \"identity\" of a passenger should be given as the  *row number* within the test data set, as above\n",
    "4. Experiment 2\n",
    "    - Turn Age from a continous variable to one that is assigned to buckets.\n",
    "        - You will decide the range for each bucket.  Discuss your choice\n",
    "        - Treat the buckets as categorical features\n",
    "    - Compare your prediction to the previous experiment and discuss\n",
    "    - Create variables SCORE_2, MISCLASSIFIED_SURVIVE_2, MISCLASSIFIED_NOT_SURVIVE_2 analagous to the variables in Experiment 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "The correctness part of your grade will depend on the values you assign to these variables.    "
