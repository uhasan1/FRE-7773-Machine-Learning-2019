    "# Why TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is Google's framework for developing Machine Learning models and is has emerged as the most popular machine learning library. Since 2011, Google Brain Team has been developing TensorFlow and used it internally. It was released as an open-source software in Nov, 2015. It comes packed with a wide range of tools from dataset management to a good selection of high-level algorithms and even ready made models and a web based dashboard. That's a lot to pack in one solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "The team that is working on developing TensorFlow are some of the most influencal researchers in machine learning. There is also a huge amount of contributors and commits for a relativly new project on Github. You quickly realize that TensorFlow is getting more attention from people in the field than any other existing machine learning solution and will be the technology starndard for machine learning development.\n",

It is also useful for non-developers working in other fields like statistics, medical field, marketing or social studies and eager to experiment with machine learning in their fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It uses data instead of code to produce logic. The goal is to create software that can perform tasks that we usually equate with human level intelligence. In some cases it could exceed human level of intelligence like what happened with Alpha Go and some other examples. You actually use machine learning all the time without realizing when you use Google, YouTube, Amazon and so many other services that reley on machine learning to give you a better experience.\n",

    " \n",
    "To kick of this section, We'll start with a few simple concepts:\n",
    " \n",
    "## The real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$\n",
    " \n",
    "The real numbers include positive, nagative numbers and zero. They can be of arbitrary precesion meaning they can have any number of decimal points or even numbers with infinite precision. The set real is denoted in mathimatics as $\\mathbb{R}$. Examples of real numbers include:\n",

    "$$ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For longer sums like getting the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000 can be harder to write in that way. We use sum denoted in mathematics as capital letter Sigma $\\Sigma$. To rewite the previous equation from 1 to 1000 using sum, you can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{n=1}^{1000} n$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = x + 2x + 3x + 4x + 5x = \\sum_{n=1}^{5}nx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation we can even represent an infinite sum of numbers:\n",
